# distributed-homomorphic
Distributed database system utilizing homomorphic encryption to enable decentralized untrusted relational database hosting.

## Technologies

1. CryptDB - Encryption scheme to support homomorphic encryption for SQL operations.
2. CockroachDB - Distributed database engine supporting ACID transactions.
3. Zerotier - Networking system to create VPN's across devices.
4. Django - Backend for user/host interfaces.

### CryptDB

A homomorphic encryption SQL database program that can be used with most popular SQL engines (MySQL, Postgres, etc.). Paper Link: https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/raluca-cryptdb-tr.pdf.

### CockroachDB

An open-source distributed database engine based on Google's Spanner. Link: https://www.cockroachlabs.com.

### Zerotier

An open-source go-based framework to manage network routing to create VPN's for peer-to-peer connections. Link: https://www.zerotier.com. 

### Django

A popular python-based open-source backend framework supporting ORM. Link: https://www.djangoproject.com.

## TODO

1. Modify CryptDB to use CockroachDB.
2. Create/explore a system to track usage.
3. Test CockroachDB using Zerotier.
4. Test a basic Django application with whole encrypted system.
